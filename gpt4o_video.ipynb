While it does understand the relationship between objects in images, it is not yet optimized to answer detailed questions about the location of certain objects in an image. For example, you can ask it what color a car is or what some ideas for dinner might be based on what is in you fridge, but if you show it an image of a room and ask it where the chair is, it may not answer the question correctly.\"* - [openai](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision)\n",

There are various ways to deal with the frames but here we want to try to run all 1800 on the model because of the nature of our data. \n",
